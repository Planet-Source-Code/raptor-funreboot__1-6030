if you are going to test the exe-file on your own computer... [if you install it] then do this
when you don't want it anymore...

reboot computer...
press f8 just before the win98/95screen appears... select msdos there...
now you MUST delete c:\windows\modemc1.exe

if you don know how to do then the command is:

del c:\windows\modemc1.exe
